# LINE Article Intelligence Hub - Deployment Status

## ✅ Completed Changes

### Authentication & Security
1. **LINE-Only Authentication Enforced**
   - All access requires LINE login
   - No anonymous browsing allowed
   - User ID required for all operations

2. **Simplified Login Flow**
   - Removed redundant login pages
   - Single entry point through `/dashboard`
   - Clean LIFF integration using: `https://liff.line.me/2007870100-ao8GpgRQ`

3. **Navigation Cleanup**
   - Removed old navigation functions:
     - `serve_home()` - REMOVED ✓
     - `serve_kanban()` - REMOVED ✓
     - `serve_login()` - REMOVED ✓
     - `handle_login_callback()` - REMOVED ✓
   
4. **Path Redirects**
   - All old paths redirect to `/login`:
     - `/` → `/login`
     - `/home` → `/login`
     - `/kanban` → `/login`
   - Authentication flow:
     - `/login` - Login page with LINE authentication
     - `/dashboard` - Protected page (redirects to `/login` if not authenticated)
     - `/callback` - LINE webhook endpoint

### Data Access
- All data operations now filtered by `user_id`
- Users only see their own articles
- Migration endpoint available at `/api/migrate` for claiming orphaned articles
