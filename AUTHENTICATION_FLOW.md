# LINE Article Intelligence Hub - Authentication Flow

## ✅ Corrected Authentication Flow

You were absolutely right! The login functionality should be at `/login`, not `/dashboard`. Here's what I've implemented:

### 🔐 Authentication Routes

1. **`/login`** - Login page
   - Beautiful login interface with LINE branding
   - Shows app features and benefits
   - LINE login button that initiates authentication
   - Auto-redirects to `/dashboard` if already logged in

2. **`/dashboard`** - Protected dashboard
   - Requires LINE authentication
   - Shows user's articles and statistics
   - Automatically redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
   - Personalized view based on user ID

3. **Path Redirects**
   - `/` → `/login`
   - `/home` → `/login`
   - `/kanban` → `/login`

### 🔄 Complete User Journey

```
1. User visits app (any URL)
      ↓
2. Redirected to /login
      ↓
3. Sees login page with LINE button
      ↓
4. Clicks "Login with LINE"
      ↓
5. LINE authentication flow
      ↓
6. Success → Redirected to /dashboard
      ↓
7. Dashboard shows personalized content
```

### 📝 Key Features of Login Page

- **Clean Design**: Professional gradient background with centered login box
- **LINE Branding**: Official LINE logo and green color scheme
- **Feature List**: Shows benefits of using the app
- **LIFF Integration**: Uses LINE Front-end Framework for seamless auth
- **Auto-redirect**: If already logged in, goes straight to dashboard

### 🛡️ Security Features

- No anonymous access to any data
- All API endpoints require authentication
- User data isolation (users only see their own articles)
- Secure LIFF token validation
- Server-side user ID verification

### 📱 Mobile Experience

The login page is fully responsive and works perfectly within the LINE app:
- Opens in LINE's in-app browser
- Seamless authentication without leaving LINE
- Maintains session across app switches

This follows web development best practices where:
- `/login` is the standard path for authentication
- `/dashboard` is for authenticated content
- Clear separation between public and protected routes

Thank you for the correction! This makes the authentication flow much more intuitive and follows industry standards.
