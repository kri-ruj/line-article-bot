# Persistent Storage Setup ✅

Your Article Intelligence Hub now has **persistent storage** using Google Cloud Storage!

## 🎉 What's New

### Automatic Backup
- **Every 30 seconds**: Database automatically syncs to Google Cloud Storage
- **On shutdown**: Final sync ensures no data loss
- **Manual sync**: Available via `/api/sync` endpoint

### Data Persistence
- ✅ **Survives deployments**: Your articles, users, and progress are preserved
- ✅ **Survives crashes**: Automatic recovery from Cloud Storage on startup
- ✅ **Survives updates**: No more data loss when fixing bugs or adding features

## 📦 Storage Details

- **Bucket**: `gs://secondbrain-app-20250612-article-data`
- **Database**: `articles.db` (automatically managed)
- **Region**: `asia-northeast1` (same as your Cloud Run service)

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **On Startup**:
   - Checks Google Cloud Storage for existing database
   - Downloads if exists, creates new if not
   - Starts background sync thread

2. **During Operation**:
   - Every 30 seconds, database is backed up to Cloud Storage
   - All changes are preserved automatically
   - No manual intervention needed

3. **On Deployment**:
   - New container downloads latest database from Cloud Storage
   - All your data is immediately available
   - Seamless transition with zero data loss

## 📱 New Commands

### LINE Bot Commands
- `/backup` - Check backup status and database info
- `/stats` - View your article statistics (preserved!)
- `/list` - See your saved articles (all still there!)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/backup` - Download database backup
- `POST /api/sync` - Force immediate sync
- `GET /health` - Shows last sync time and database size

## 🔐 Security

- Database stored securely in your private Google Cloud Storage bucket
- Access controlled by Cloud Run service account
- No public access to your data
- Encrypted at rest by Google Cloud

## 💰 Cost

- **Storage**: ~$0.02/GB per month (your DB is tiny, essentially free)
- **Operations**: First 5GB of operations free per month
- **Estimated monthly cost**: Less than $0.01

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **No More Data Loss**: Every article you save is permanently stored
2. **Seamless Updates**: Deploy new versions without losing progress
3. **Backup Built-in**: Automatic cloud backups every 30 seconds
4. **Download Anytime**: Get your database via `/api/backup`
5. **Multi-User Ready**: Each user's data persists independently

## 📊 Monitoring

Check storage status:
```bash
# View bucket contents
gsutil ls -l gs://secondbrain-app-20250612-article-data/

# Download backup locally
gsutil cp gs://secondbrain-app-20250612-article-data/articles.db ./backup.db

# Check database size
gsutil du -h gs://secondbrain-app-20250612-article-data/
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

Your data is now safe! You can:
1. Deploy updates without worry
2. Add new features without data loss
3. Scale to more users with confidence
4. Sleep better knowing your data is backed up

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you ever need to restore manually:
```bash
# Download backup
gsutil cp gs://secondbrain-app-20250612-article-data/articles.db ./articles_backup.db

# Upload restored database
gsutil cp ./articles_backup.db gs://secondbrain-app-20250612-article-data/articles.db

# Redeploy service to pick up restored database
gcloud run services update article-hub --region asia-northeast1
```
